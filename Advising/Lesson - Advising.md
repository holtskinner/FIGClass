## Doesn't Adrianna/Tami/Victor plan my degree for me???

- Not really
- They offer advice, but it‚Äôs ultimately up to you on what classes you take and when
- You need to understand how the curriculum works for your department
  - It will make your life easier!
  - If you know what you‚Äôre doing, you will have shorter advisor meetings!

## The Advising Process

- The college of engineering requires each student to meet with their advisor every semester before registering for classes.
- If you look in MyZou, you will see this Hold on your account
    - Might also have more depending
    - Prevents you from registering for classes
- This is designed to keep you on track to graduate

## Adding/Changing/Declaring Majors
- Currently, all of you are technically ‚ÄúUndeclared-Engineering‚Äù (I think)
- Some get auto-admitted to their department based upon ACT, rank, etc.
- You can apply while you are currently enrolled in the final required classes.
- Each department has specific requirements to get in (classes, GPA)
